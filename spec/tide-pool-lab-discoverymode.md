## Tide Pool Lab (v0.1): DiscoveryMode × Fox’s Anvil Bridge

This is a commons pattern for a **low-impact learning interface** between students and marine ecosystems.
Instead of “touching the ocean,” we build a **controlled micro-ecosystem** that prioritizes:
- safety (for students and organisms),
- minimal ecological disruption,
- shared learning across many gardens (the Knowledge Loop),
- and a repair/care ethic aligned with Fox’s Anvil.

This is not complete. It is designed to evolve through local practice and shared logs.

## Purpose
A Tide Pool Lab is a shallow, modular, recirculating “micro-tide-pool” layer that students can study without treating open water as a sandbox.

The lab is for:
- observation and pattern recognition,
- water chemistry literacy,
- habitat design (what helps organisms thrive),
- and inter-garden knowledge exchange (CodeTape → shared commons learning).

---

## Core ethic: “Minimum Harm, Maximum Learning”
### Non-negotiables
- **Observe-first.**
- **Native-only** organisms and materials (or locally approved equivalents).
- **No collecting** unless it is part of an approved research/rehab protocol.
- **No stress for spectacle.**
- Any intervention must have a clear care purpose and a reversal plan.

### The “Harm Audit” (after every session)
Students answer:
1) What did we touch or change?
2) Did we increase stress? How do we know?
3) What did we do to reduce harm?
4) What will we do differently next time?

---

## Physical pattern (v0.1 build)
### The Tide Pool Trays
- one or more **shallow trays** (modular, removable)
- fed by **filtered system water** (or a dedicated, filtered loop)
- **gentle low-flow intake** (no suction traps)
- **gentle return** (avoid shear + avoid aeration blasts directly into the tray)

### “Rock modules” (swap-able habitat pieces)
- removable “habitat tiles” or modules (rock-like structure, shells, safe rough surfaces)
- designed to be lifted, inspected, cleaned, and returned
- clearly labeled zones (edge, mid, sheltered pocket)

### Isolation / quarantine mode
The Tide Pool Lab must be able to isolate from the main loop if:
- organisms show distress,
- water chemistry swings,
- contamination is suspected.

Goal: protect the main system from learning experiments.

---

## What students can study (examples)
- algae growth and grazing patterns
- micro-invertebrate behavior (when locally appropriate)
- biofilm succession on different materials
- temperature / pH / DO shifts across a day
- effects of shade, flow rate, and habitat complexity
- “who interacts with whom” (food webs and symbiosis)

---

## Roles (DiscoveryMode-style stewardship)
These roles rotate.

### 1) The Watcher
Observes quietly first. Notes behavior and interactions before any measurements.

### 2) The Waterkeeper
Runs water checks (temp, pH, ammonia/nitrite if relevant, DO if available).
Calls “pause” if thresholds are crossed.

### 3) The Storykeeper
Writes the day’s short field story: what was seen, what changed, what mattered.

### 4) The Mechanic
Checks the physical system: flow, intake safety, overflow capture, leaks, tray stability.

### 5) The Data Sender (CodeTape)
Formats a small, consistent log entry to share with other nodes.

## Minimum viable measurements (2 minutes)
Daily:
- date/time
- water context (fresh/river/bay/open water)
- temperature
- pH
- clarity note (clear / slightly cloudy / cloudy)
- one “interaction note” (who did what with whom)
- one “care action” (what we did to reduce harm)
- any events (storm, power dip, filter clean, unusual wildlife contact)

Optional (if you have it):
- dissolved oxygen
- turbidity value
- salinity (brackish systems)

---

## CodeTape format: share the pulse
Suggested record fields (human-readable):
- node_id
- water_context
- temp_c
- pH
- clarity
- DO (optional)
- observation
- change_made
- harm_audit_1line
- next_test

Principle: share patterns and outcomes, not private data.

---

## Safety rails (student + organism)
Stop the session if:
- organisms show distress (lethargy, abnormal movement, mass retreat)
- sudden cloudiness or sharp smell appears
- DO drops (if measured) or gasping behavior is observed
- equipment creates suction hazard or physical instability

Immediate actions:
1) stop interaction
2) reduce disturbance
3) increase aeration in main system (if needed)
4) isolate the Tide Pool Lab (quarantine mode)
5) log what happened (“leave a trace”)

---

## Inter-garden learning: why this matters
A Tide Pool Lab is an **education station** and a **commons sensor node**.
Over time, many nodes can compare:
- how different waterbodies behave (river vs bay vs fresh)
- seasonal shifts
- material tests (which habitat tiles build healthy biofilm)
- early warning patterns (oxygen drops, turbidity spikes)

This is how the project grows ethically: not by scaling fast, but by learning together.

---

## Commons reminder
This lab is a bridge between Fox’s Anvil and DiscoveryMode:
- tools that help people care,
- learning that minimizes harm,
- and shared knowledge that helps many gardens—not just one.
