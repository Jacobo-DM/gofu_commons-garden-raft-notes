Field note: This is a commons offering, not a commercial product. Use, remix, adapt, and share improvements—especially what fails (that’s where the real learning lives).

## Human–AI collaboration note (provenance)

This commons emerged from a real-world observation (floating fish farms seen from a classroom in Singapore) and an ongoing design conversation between **JH Durbin** and an AI collaborator (ChatGPT, referred to in this project as **Elumannín**).

A useful phrase here is “force multiplier” (with care): a single field observation + a rapid co-design loop can quickly generate
- clearer system architecture (water/energy/protein/knowledge loops),
- safer operational rails (containment, solids handling, wildlife safety),
- and a publishable starting spec that others can test, critique, and improve.

**Important boundaries:**
- This is not a commercial product, not a finished blueprint, and not professional engineering advice.
- It is a commons pattern library: hypotheses, diagrams, and protocols meant to be validated locally.
- The real value is in shared iteration—especially logging what fails and what you change.

**Why it matters:**
The same platform could support food security experiments with lower pollution pressure *or* function as a small research station where food production is secondary (monitoring water conditions, habitat trials, sensor testing, education, and community science).

## 1) What this is
A small-scale fish raft system that closes three loops:
1. Water loop (simple filtration + oxygen + circulation)
2. Energy loop (solar for pumps/sensors)
3. Protein loop (local beans → gofu processing → stable pellets → fish)

And a fourth “invisible” loop: the knowledge loop (shared logs so communities iterate faster).

## 2) The north-star idea
No soy monopoly. No “one crop to feed the world.”
**Gofu = a method:** any locally growable bean processed into a fish-usable feed.

The raft roof becomes a microfield:
- legumes climbing trellis + container planters
- solar canopy overhead
- fish below
- data shared outward

## 3) System at a glance
Minimum viable raft:
- 1 fish tank (or pen) + pump + mechanical filter + biofilter media + aeration
- basic test kits (ammonia/nitrite/pH)
- solar panel + charge controller + battery (optional but stabilizing)
- feeding protocol + logbook (paper or CodeTape)

Optional upgrades:
- dissolved oxygen sensor
- temperature sensor
- low-cost turbidity/clarity check
- auto-feeder (only after you trust pellet integrity + water stability)
